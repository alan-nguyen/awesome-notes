### e. Color Theory 
### f. Color for UI
- Having a neutral background (any color with low lightness or saturation) is a good base
- a dark background with light colored text can be a reasonable alternative
- [Brand color](https://brandcolors.net/) is a hue that should dominate your color palette.
  -  accounts for roughly 60% of the color used 
- Button color can determine a lot in the user’s eyes
  - hover state (a shade or tint of the accent color )
  - disabled state
- Using a darker gray for text on a white background, or white text on a dark gray background,
- Whitespace, or negative space, refers to the emptiness between elements.
- Color blindness
  - red-green (difficult to differentiate between the red and green colors)
  - blue-yellow (blues tend to appear greener)
  - monochromatic (can’t see color at all)

This is a helpful tool to make it easier to work with color and build palettes.

### g. Text Design
**#HTML Headers**
- Differentiating important pieces of text, such as titles and subtitles
- HTML Best Practice
  - \<h1> — Used for titles.
        You should only have one header this style per page.
  - \<h2> — Used for headings.
        This should be to identify major sections you want the user to immediately be drawn towards.
  - \<h3> — Used for subheadings.
      > This should be used for smaller focal points, such as articles, that you want the user to notice when scanning the page.

**#Fonts**
- have most of your text in a serif font, and then create contrast with headings or subheadings in a sans-serif font
- can contrast between different pieces of text in a number of ways:
  - style
  - size
  - weight
  - color

**#Text Readability**
- Make sure that your text is big enough (over 16px).
- Have a strong contrast between the foreground and the background.
- Make sure there is enough space between lines and letters (remember, whitespace is king!)

How can we adjust whitespace within the text?
- Line spacing (leading) - distance between two lines of text
- Tracking - the space between the letters and the words
- Kerning - the space between two letters

**#Text Navigation**
- Stick to conventions about showing what is clickable
- Never use blue as a general accent color for text
- Having text on navigation buttons is important

If you organize the text into columns, the user’s eyes will likely not travel across the entire screen, they will travel to the end of a column and then down. 

**#Text length, columns, and line length**
- Text length - The average internet paragraph is only 1-3 sentences.
- Line length - has a larger impact than you would expect on the reader
  > Each time a reader gets to a new line the mind is slightly energized and encouraged (“Typographie”, E. Ruder).
  - users prefer shorter line lengths 
  - columns contain roughly 50-75 characters per line

**#What Content will the Users Notice and Remember?**
- Primacy and recency effects
  - People will notice and remember the first and last elements of a list or a page
- Image pairing
  - Users eyes are easily drawn to images quicker than they are to text.
  - This pairing can be accomplished by grouping with card designs (putting them in a div together with a shared background color).

**#F-Shaped skimming**
- You need to write and format your text with this skimmer in mind.
- Users will scan content on the left of the screen before the right of the screen, and the top of the screen before the bottom of the screen. Our eyes jump back to the left of the screen whenever we finish reading a line.
